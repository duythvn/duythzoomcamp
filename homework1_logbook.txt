## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 15767
- 15612
- 15859
- 89009
SELECT COUNT (*) 
FROM
	green_taxi_trips t	
WHERE 
	lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-09-18 00:00:00' 	AND  lpep_dropoff_datetime < '2019-09-20 00:00:00'

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance?
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Tip: For every trip on a single day, we only care about the trip with the longest distance. 

- 2019-09-18
- 2019-09-16
- 2019-09-26 --> 1
- 2019-09-21

----------
#check distance each date and compare
SELECT
	SUM(trip_distance) as distance 
FROM
	green_taxi_trips t	
WHERE 
	lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2019-09-21 00:00:00' 	AND  '2019-09-21 23:59:59'
ORDER BY distance  desc

## Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?
 
- "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"   --> 1
- "Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"
- "Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens" 
- "Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"

--------------------
SELECT
	SUM(total_amount) as total_amount,
	zdo."Borough" as pick_up_borough
FROM
	green_taxi_trips t 
	JOIN zones zpu	ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
	JOIN zones zdo	ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"	
WHERE 
	lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2019-09-01 00:00:00' 	AND  '2019-09-30 23:59:59'	
GROUP BY  pick_up_borough
ORDER BY total_amount desc

## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's `tip` , not `trip`

- Central Park
- Jamaica
- JFK Airport
- Long Island City/Queens Plaza --> 1

------------
SELECT
	SUM(tip_amount) as tip,
 	zdo."Zone" as drop_off_zone,
	zpu."Zone" as pick_up_zone
FROM
	green_taxi_trips t 
	JOIN zones zpu	ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
	JOIN zones zdo	ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"	
WHERE 
	lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2019-09-01 00:00:00' 	AND  '2019-09-30 23:59:59'
	AND zpu."Zone" = 'Astoria'	
GROUP BY  drop_off_zone,pick_up_zone
ORDER BY tip desc
